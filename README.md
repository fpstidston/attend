# Attend
An agenda service for reviewing how you spend your time

Monitor attendance by building up a picture about what is really happening and what is not. Then direct that data by what you enjoy the most, what you do the most and when it happened.

### Example

Imagine at school rating each class based on your own performance, the teacher, the material covered, for example. Then identifying to your parents and teachers what you like and what youâ€™d like more help with.
